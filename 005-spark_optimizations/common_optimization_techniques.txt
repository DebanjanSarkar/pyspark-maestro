Common Spark Optimization Techniques:
--------------------------------------

1. Salting
2. Bucketing
3. Setting number of shuffle partitions to a multiple of total number of executor cores.
4. Broadcast Join
5. Tuning partition count and segregation at external level (ex: Kafka topics must be partitioned at source level, leveraging spark parallelism from the read stage itself, etc...)
